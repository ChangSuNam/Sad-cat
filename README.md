# Sad-cat

This code displays a sad cat on your ESP32 with screen size of 160 * 128.


Connect your ESP32 to your laptop. With Arduino, open the code and upload it to your ESP32. If it gives you an error, make sure the correct port is chosen on the Tools menu.

And if you didn't, please give your cat a hug.
